# Helsinki City bike App (Solita Dev Academy pre-assignment)

This is an app that you can check a few different things regarding helsinki city bike stations and trips with. 
The app has 3 main pages(+ a home page that has and introduction to the app)
The app is build with react.js, and was originally built with node.js as a back-end and Postgresql as the database, but due to the complications with such a database with millions of rows being quite difficult to host in the cloud affordably, I decided it was best to make a local file in the project that has a small amount of the data.

## 1. Journey List

From the journey list you can check trips that have been completed using city bikes. It telss you the starting station name, return station name, distance travelled in meters and trip duration in seconds. 

## 2. Stations list
 
From the stations list you can find the names of all bike stations in helsinki. 

## 3. Stations

From stations you can find every stations individually with extra info. You can find the name, address, amount of departures and amount of returns. 

## Instructions:

The app works by simply clicking the link on "about" section of this github page. It is hosted with github pages.
